For this project I analysed the AirBnB acommodation data for Berlin. The aim was to answer following questions:
1. What are the most frequent neighbourhoods for accommodations on AirBnB in Berlin?
2. Which neighbourhoods are most affordable?
3. What are major factors driving acommodation prices on AirBnB in Berlin?
